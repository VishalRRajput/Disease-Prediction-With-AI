# 🩺 Disease Prediction with AI

This project builds a **Machine Learning model** that predicts whether a patient is likely to have **heart disease** based on their medical attributes.  
It uses a dataset of patient health records, applies preprocessing, visualization, and trains models to make accurate predictions.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset comes from [Kaggle - Heart Disease Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/redwankarimsony/heart-disease-data).  
It includes features like:

- Age  
- Sex  
- Chest pain type  
- Resting blood pressure  
- Serum cholesterol level  
- Fasting blood sugar  
- Resting electrocardiographic results  
- Maximum heart rate achieved  
- Exercise induced angina  
- ST depression / slope values  
- Number of major vessels  
- Thalassemia  
- Target (disease present or not)

## ⚙️ What the Project Does
✅ Cleans and preprocesses the raw dataset (handles missing values, encodes categorical features, scales numerical features).  
✅ Performs **Exploratory Data Analysis** (EDA) with histograms and heatmaps.  
✅ Trains ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.).  
✅ Predicts whether a person has **heart disease (Yes/No)**.  
✅ Evaluates model accuracy and performance.
